# Best Books Backend

**Author**: Vince Masten
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
This is the backend that sends RESTful data (currently via the /books endpoint) for the frontend to render. Data to be sent is stored in a Mongo database.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repo
2. Install package dependencies with `npm i`
3. Make sure MongoDB is set up and running
4. Fire up the frontend to see the results in a carousel

## Architecture
Uses Node.js Express and MongoDB with a few other libraries helping out (see package.json)
